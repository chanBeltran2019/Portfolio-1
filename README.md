# Portfolio-1

For this portfolio, I added four styling components. I added a component for the background of the webpage, the buttons, the header and the styling of the text inside the exercise screens. In general, I styled it to be more colorful and virbant. I made the buttons seem a bit more interactive by enlarging the size of the button on the users hover.
